# water_control_algorithm ðŸ¦ž




### Introduction
Red claw crayfish cultivation is difficult, yet valuable. Suitable water condition of redclaw crayfish is demanding and varies with location <sup>[1][2]</sup>.  

In this repository, I demonstrated water quality control algorithm I designed while working at J & KC limited as machine learning engineer. I used multivariant gaussian function to model the water's condition for red claw crayfish cultivation. I also proposed a method to produce cultivation suggestions base on output of this function.  
Enjoy!


<insert image to demonstrate my idea>


### Quick start
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
Go to `multivariant_gauss_water_quality.ipynb` and everything shall run.  
The notebook is heavily commented for demonstration purpose.


### Preprocessing data
A small chunk of water data (across two weeks) is in `water_data.csv`. They are:

| Name | Unit | Description |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Date | n/a | Date when the data is collected
| Time | n/a | Time when the data is collected
| Temperature | <sup>o </sup>C | Temperature of the water
| pH | pH | Acidity of the water|
| DO | % | Dissolve oxygen in water|
| EC | uS/cm | Electrical conductivity in water|


Lets visualize them:

![water temperature raw](Images/temp_raw.png )
![water pH raw](Images/ph_raw.png )
![water DO raw](Images/DO_raw.png )
![water EC raw](Images/EC_raw.png )

Obviously, there are some abnormal at the very end of the data, (the EC and temperature dipped rapidly), so I chose to get rid of it and use 0 to 4000 time step of data. I then z-normalized the data. Plotting the cleaned data:

### The model

We are now ready to fit the multivariant gaussian (MVG) model to the water data, more about it [here](https://cs229.stanford.edu/section/gaussians.pdf)<sup>[3]</sup>. Here is the equation for (MVG):


$$ f(x | \mu, \Sigma) = \frac{1}{(2\pi)^{\frac{n}{2}}|\Sigma|^{\frac{1}{2}}}\cdot{}exp(-\frac{1}{2}(x - \mu)^T \Sigma^{-1} (x - \mu)) $$

Where $\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix, $\mu$ is the mean, and $n$ is the dimension of the data, in our case $n = 4$.

To fit the mode using maximum likelyhood fitting, we simply need to calculate the mean and covariance matrix of the water data, and we are done.  
Heres visualization of the model in temperature and pH dimension, with EC and DO at mean value:



![Visualization of model](Images/heatmap.png)

Temperature and pH are slightly correlated, which is due to manual control of the crayfish farmer. The blue dot is [temp = 25, pH = 8.5, DO = 11, EC = 1550], which is optimal for cultivation (you can also see in the raw data plot, this is within reasonable range). The red dot is [temp = 20, pH = 8.5, DO = 11, EC = 1550], whcih is too cold for crayfish cultivation.



### Giving Cultivation Suggestion
- Core part of this algorithm: flexible method for giving suggestions
- Demonstrate with 2D example, temperature & DO 
- Showcase suggestion
ðŸš§ Under Construction! ðŸš§

### Discussion
- Auto capture correlations between water quality metrics
- Convenient way to provide cultivation suggestions
- Future work: include time encoding into it (e.g. time in the year, in day)
- Future work: base on magnitude, calculate metric for actions (e.g. covver pond for a period of time, add certain dosage of chemicals to adjust water properties)
