# water_control_algorithm
In this repo, I demonstrated my idea of using multivariant gaussian function to model water's condition for red claw crayfish cultivation. I also proposed a method to produce cultivation suggestions base on output of this function.

### Introduction

Suitable cultivation condition of redclaw crayfish is given by "show reference". This data is, however, generic, and might not be suitable in different geographical location of redclaw crayfish cultivaition.  

<insert table of data>

 In the following, I will use water quality data of a successful redclaw crayfish fish farmer in Hong Kong, to create a model indicating whether the water condition is suitable for redclaw crayfish cultivation in Hong Kong
