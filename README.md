# water_control_algorithm
In this repository, I demonstrated water quality control algorithm I designed while working at J & KC limited as machine learning engineer. I used multivariant gaussian function to model the water's condition for red claw crayfish cultivation. I also proposed a method to produce cultivation suggestions base on output of this function. Please feel free!

### Introduction

Red claw crayfish cultivation is difficult. Suitable cultivation condition of redclaw crayfish is given by "show reference". This data is, however, generic, and might not be suitable in different geographical location of redclaw crayfish cultivaition.  

<insert table of data>

 In the following, I will use water quality data of a successful redclaw crayfish fish farmer in Hong Kong, to create a model indicating whether the water condition is suitable for redclaw crayfish cultivation in Hong Kong

<insert image to demonstrate my idea>


### Quick start

### Preprocessing data
- Eliminate extreme values
< visualize the data>

- Normalize the data
- Thats pretty much it


### The model
- Show equation of multivariant gaussian
- Fit the model using maximum likelyhood estimation
- We are done!
ðŸš§ Under Construction! ðŸš§


### Giving Cultivation Suggestion
- Core part of this algorithm: flexible method for giving suggestions
- Demonstrate with 2D example, temperature & DO 
- Showcase suggestion
ðŸš§ Under Construction! ðŸš§

### Discussion
- Auto capture correlations between water quality metrics
- Convenient way to provide cultivation suggestions
- Future work: include time encoding into it (e.g. time in the year, in day)
